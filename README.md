All notes can be read with cat or bat/batcat

to run my custom Debian bootstrap on a clean build.

This installs Homebrew on your debian linux for a few packages that are not on debian repos eg. zellij dust etc.

Once complete you will have a system ready to apt, nala, brew with ai chat using tgpt.


1.)  download bootstrap.sh file

2.)  mv bootstrap.sh to $HOME folder

3.)  chmod +x bootstrap.sh

4.) ./bootstrap.sh
