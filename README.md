to run my custom Debian bootstrap on a clean build. This build has been tested on Debian stable but should work with otherbranhces and Ubuntu or other debian derivative distros as well.

This installs Homebrew on your debian linux for a few packages that are not on debian repos eg. zellij dust etc.

Once complete you will have a system ready to apt, nala, brew with ai chat using tgpt.


1.)  download bootstrap.sh file

2.)  mv bootstrap.sh to $HOME folder

3.)  chmod +x bootstrap.sh

4.) ./bootstrap.sh
